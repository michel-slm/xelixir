Elixir is a dynamic, functional language designed for building scalable and maintainable applications. The syntax is inspired by Ruby, and it borrows many constructs from Lisp languages, especially Clojure.

Elixir leverages the Erlang VM, known for running low-latency, distributed and fault-tolerant systems, while also being successfully used in web development and the embedded software domain.

The home page for Elixir is [elixir-lang.org](http://elixir-lang.org/).
